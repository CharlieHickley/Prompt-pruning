This is the code used in a research project which I undertook with UCL professor Earl Barr, the head of the systems software engineering group there. This research was to find out what part of a large langauge model prompt makes a prompt "good". This was done by finding a prompt which has been deemed to be "good" 
then removing certain parts of the prompt and checking if the output from the large language model from the shortened prompt was similar to the original output and therefore also "good". This allowed us to find out what parts of prompts are useful to get a "good" output from a large langauge model.
